## How to place the Parsons Problem into the Canvas LMS
> In order to import a Parson's Problem into the Canvas LMS it seems that we will need to use an iframe to import a webpage from somewhere else. In order to use the iframe and have it work for everyone the webpage we import must use https rather than http.
>
> ### Ideas for webpage hosting
> - We may be able to use github pages for the webpage generation as that is what js-parsons used for their example and it worked just fine.
> - We could use AWS to host it.

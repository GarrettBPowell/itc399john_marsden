<p>During this quiz, you may not access or view any other materials, 
either course notes, previous homework submissions or any online material; 
nor may you attempt to communicate with any person other than the instructor.<p>

<p>Write a program that prompts the user to enter a series of integer values
terminating in 0. When the input is done, report whether there were
more positive than negative values ("Positive"),
more negative than positive values ("Negative"),
or an equal number of positive and negative values ("Equal").
Note that we do not want the sum of the numbers, 
just a comparison of the relative count of positive vs. negative numbers.

<!--
<p>
Your solution must use a <b>while</b> loop.
</p>
-->
<p>Your program should run like the examples shown below:</p>

<pre class=cmd>
Enter number: <span class=input>2</span>
Enter number: <span class=input>-35</span>
Enter number: <span class=input>7</span>
Enter number: <span class=input>0</span>

Positive
</pre>

<p>
In the first example (above): there are two positive numbers (2,7) and 
one negative number (-35), so there are more positive numbers than negative,
as indicated in the output.
</p>

<pre class=cmd>
Enter number: <span class=input>0</span>

Equal
</pre>

<pre class=cmd>
Enter number: <span class=input>-3</span>
Enter number: <span class=input>-10</span>
Enter number: <span class=input>-5</span>
Enter number: <span class=input>0</span>

Negative
</pre>

<p><b>Note</b>: this program is given as a quiz, 
part of an ongoing assessment of your progress in the class.
It may be graded differently from homework assignments.
Athene will provide an estimated score, but your final score will
be determined by the instructor upon reviewing your work;
the final score may be higher or lower than the automated score.</p>
